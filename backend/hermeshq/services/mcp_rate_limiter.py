"""Per-token rate limiter using an in-memory sliding window.

This module provides a sliding-window rate limiter keyed by token ID.
Each token maintains a ``deque`` of request timestamps; requests older
than the configured window are evicted on every ``check`` call.  A
periodic ``cleanup`` is recommended to remove tokens that have gone
idle and prevent unbounded memory growth.

    The limiter tracks the number of requests made by each ``token_id``
    inside a rolling time window.  When the number of recorded requests
    equals or exceeds ``max_requests`` within ``window_seconds``, further
    requests are rejected with an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_requests:
        Maximum number of requests allowed per token within the window.
    window_seconds:
        Width of the sliding window in seconds.

    Example
    -------
    >>> limiter = McpRateLimiter(max_requests=100, window_seconds=60)
    >>> await limiter.check("token-abc")  # succeeds
    >>> # … 100 more rapid calls …
    >>> await limiter.check("token-abc")  # raises HTTPException(429)
